

This directory contains files that can be used to run hdrdmacp
in server mode as a service on systems supporting systemd
(e.g. RHEL7). To use do the following:

1. Copy hdrdmacp.service and hdrdma.service.d to /etc/systemd/system

2. Either modify the /etc/systemd/system/hdrdmacp.service file
   to include the full path to the hdrdmacp executable or create
	a /etc/systemd/system/hdrdma.service.d/environment file that
	appends to PATH. You may also need to append to LD_LIBRARY_PATH

3. Enable the service by running the following as sudo/root:

      systemctl enable hdrdmacp


You can then check the status with "systemctl status hdrdmacp".
You can also check the log of output with:

  journalctl -u hdrdmacp.service
